# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The game allows two players to play against each other in a classic 3Ã—3 board.

## Features
- **Two-Player Mode**: Players take turns placing their marks (**X** or **O**).
- **Win detection**: The game recognizes when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
- **Reset functionality**: Players can restart the game at any time.
- **Basic UI animations**: Smooth transitions for a better user experience.
- **Built with Flexbox**: The layout is styled using CSS Flexbox for a responsive and clean design.
- **Planned Responsive Design**: Currently not fully responsive, but future updates will improve adaptability across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS (Flexbox & Animations)**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, win detection, and user interactions.

2. Players take turns clicking on the board to place their marks (**X** or **O**).
3. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
